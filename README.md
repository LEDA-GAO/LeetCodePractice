# LeetCodePractice
record my practice on leetcode about C++ 
## Problem1. two sum
The file name is leetP1.cpp. \
I learned to use the unordered_map(hashtable). By using it, the code can finally reach a time complexity O(n). 

## Problem13. Roman to Integer 
The file name is leetP13.cpp.  
unordered_map(hashtable) is used for this problem to obtian a code with time complexity O(n). 

## Problem20. Valid Parentheses 
The file name is leetP20.cpp.\
switch case is used for this problem to obtian a code with time complexity O(n). 

## Problem21. Merge Two Sorted Lists 
The file name is leetP21.cpp. \
Linked list and pointer are practiced and used to achieve a time complexity O(n1+n2).
