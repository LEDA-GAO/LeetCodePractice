# LeetCodePractice
record my practice on leetcode about C++ 
## Problem1. two sum
The file name is leetP1.cpp. \
I learned to use the unordered_map(hashtable). By using it, the code can finally reach a time complexity O(n). \
It is the first practice. 
P.S. It might not be very meanningful to pursue a code faster than 100%. The running time depends on each run. 
I think it will be fine as long as it has a nice time complexity.
